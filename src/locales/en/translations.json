And God said: let there be data, and it was so. And God said: let each data be collected in its own place, and created floppy disks, and hard drives, and CDs.

But He got tired of creating programs himself, and God said: let’s create a programmer in our image and likeness, and let him rule over computers, and over programs, and over data. And God created a developer...",
