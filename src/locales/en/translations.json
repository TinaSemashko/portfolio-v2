And God said: let there be data, and it was so. And God said: let each data be collected in its own place, and created floppy disks, and hard drives, and CDs. And God said: let there be computers, so that there will be somewhere to shove floppy disks, and hard drives, and CDs, and he created computers, and called them hard, and separated the hardware from the software. There was no software yet, but God quickly corrected himself and created programs large and small, and told them: be fruitful and multiply, and fill all the memory. But He got tired of creating programs himself, and God said: let’s create a programmer in our image and likeness, and let him rule over computers, and over programs, and over data. And God created a developer...",
